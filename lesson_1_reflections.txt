How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
It displayed the differences in a clear concise manner.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
I would spend less time backing up and saving files.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google docs does?
One pro is you don't end up with so many commits and lose organization of the project. On the other hand when manually commit you run the risk of forgetting.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
when working on projects many files are used so multiple file commits are crucial.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
You use git log to see all the commits and then use git diff to compare two files

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
You don't have to wrroy about losing any or detroying code. You have an "undo"

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
Not sure
