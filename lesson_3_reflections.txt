When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
When sharing with others

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
you might be experiementing with some code that you do not want introduced into the production version just yet.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
a) a fork is github's cloning method on their servers.
b) a clone is a duplicate of a repository either on your local machine or from github
c) a branch is part of a commit path

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?
you can work offline?

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
We would send files back and forth to each other or directly edit them on the server. it might be easier to edit the files directly on the server but it deffinately is not the best practice and could and usually does lead to code conflicts and errors.
